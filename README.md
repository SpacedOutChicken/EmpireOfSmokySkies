I've added in the Honourable Spaceship part mechanic, and cleaned up the code in a few spots. You'll notice that the stable now increases production for all land units, not just mounted units, because having a horse stable give a boost to making airships felt wrong. You'll also notice that the forge no longer increases production of spaceship parts, because increasing production of honourable titles from a blacksmith shop felt wrong.
